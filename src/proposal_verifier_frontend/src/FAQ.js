        <h2>Important Advisory</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>IC Proposal Verifier</b> is a helper tool. It surfaces proposal data, URLs, and
          helps you compute and compare hashes. <b>Manual, independent verification</b> (shell,
          reproducible builds, and careful reading of sources) remains the most reliable way to
          ensure proposal integrity. Use this app to accelerate and document your work—not to
          replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app includes <b>Internet Identity authentication</b>, <b>built-in payments</b>, and an
          <b>end-to-end verification guide</b>. Logging in lets the backend attribute fetch costs to
          your deposit subaccount, while the guide walks you through every manual step so you can
          confidently verify proposals even outside the UI.

          '1) What does “proposal verification” mean on the Internet Computer?',
          `
            It’s the process of independently confirming that the <em>payload</em> of an NNS
            proposal (e.g., a Wasm upgrade, IC-OS release image, or a set of PDF documents) and
            any linked source (e.g., Git commit) are exactly what the proposer claims. At minimum,
            you: (a) fetch the referenced artifact(s), (b) compute a cryptographic hash
            (typically SHA-256), and (c) compare against the hash in the proposal or official docs.

          `
            Decentralization depends on <em>many eyes</em>. Independent verification reduces
            central points of trust and catches accidental or malicious mismatches. It also
            teaches the community how to reproduce builds, increasing transparency and resilience.

          `
            When multiple community members independently rebuild/rehash artifacts and reach the
            same result, it forms a distributed attestation that’s hard to subvert. Over time,
            reproducibility and public verification reports become a norm.

            Risks include unverified binaries running in governance-critical places, tampered
            documents, or reference commits that don’t match the artifact. These reduce trust and

            missing cycles. Verify that your customized beneficiary address is a valid account identifier (64 hex chars) and that
            the ledger fees are funded. Finally, re-run <code>dfx deploy</code> after any code changes to pick up new constants.
